# LinkedIn Learning Python course by Joe Marini
# Example file for variables and basic types


# Basic data types in python: Numbers, Strings, Booleans
# Variable names must start with a letter or _, they cannot start with a number, but can have numbers within it.
# Variables are case sensitive. 


myint = 10
myfloat = 13.235
mystr = "this is a string"
mybool = True

# Operators are use to perform operations on variabels.
print(myint + myfloat)
print(myint * myfloat)
print(myint / myfloat)
print(myint % 3)

another_str = "This is another string"

print(mystr + another_str)
print("Batman " * 3)

# Logical and comparison operators
print(myint == 10)
print(myfloat != 20)
print(myint > 20)
print(myfloat < 10)
